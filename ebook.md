TRADE YOUR WAY TO THE TOP
======

## Step Five
Build a helathy self-esteem with a series of short steps. One reason many people never attempt new things is their fear of failure. Start a new rading strategy with an amount you are confident you can handle, and then capitalize the gains. Paper trading can be usueful to build momentum in this context.

One sensible word of caution about self-esteem is appropriate ate this point. If you have been making an overdraft on the bank of confidence all your life, you cannot expect to bring your account up-to-date in one day or by reading this text only once. The longer and more regularly you take the necessary steps and follow the recommended procedures teh better chance ou have of achieveing your goals.


## Step Six
Join the smile and gratittude club. When you recognize and genuinely appreciate something hat is going well with your trading career, your motivation and chance to improve increase. If you are managing a portfolio of any size, you're a managing something!! It's a blessing! If you're following the financial world through TV, newspaper, podcast or radio, you are part of a larger system. Be appreciative!

## Step Seven
Give some money away. Especially if you feel poor, you must know that: (1) there is always someone that has it worst than ou do. By thinkning about them, by recognizing their value, by connecting with them, you begin to feel rich withtin yourself again. (2) you know that your goal is not strictly to accumulate money. It's probably to master a craft, to gather new insights, to feel like a contributing par tof a larger system. Wthout that the money woutld be meaningless.

## Step Eight.
Be careful with your associates. Deliberately choose input sources of values. The line between the financial industry and the gambling industry is a thin one. Many brokers and TV reporters benefit from excess activity and provide a sophisticated and expensive form of enterntainment. Prefer slow moving, "boring", sources that avoid the plagues of hyperactivity and hyperconnectnedenss. Prefer text to audio, and audio to video. Choose long structural content rather than short tactical one.

## Step Nine.
Make a list of your market edges, and keep themnearby. Check your memory for your past successses and try to determine what was your distinguishable quality. Why did you make it in the markets in the past when others didn't? What did you see? Why did you see that and others didn't?

## Step Ten.
Make a list of your top ten trades, to remind you of what is possible when you get some luck and your ind is in the right place.

## Step Eleven.
To build a ealthy self-esteem you need to avoid gambling. Trading for eterntainment is extremly expensive and psychologically damning. It shows human beings at their most vulnerable place, implying that the whole economic system is corrupted and that there aren't any legitimate ways to make money than taking a huge random risk.

## Step Tweleve. 
Fail forward. Keep a journal of your past failures, and to your best ability the interpretation of why they happened. Odds are strong that the leading traders in the world miss most times than all the other traders combined. These people succeed because they keep at it.  The big difference beween the big shot and the little shot is: the big shot is just a little shot who kept on shooting. There isn't a leader who wasn't a beginner.

## Step Thirteen
Accoutanbility is essential. Try to manage other people's money so that you are accountable.

## Step Fourteen
Put yourself out there. Your skilss have value, your trading might benefit somebody else's finanaces. Don't just trade for yourself benefiting your trading account. 

## Step Fifteen
Run a lean operation. Apart from your trading account, also focus on your bank account. How are you spending your euros? Is it in an useful way? Does it benefit yourself, your community and the world at large? If not, why?

Main message: Accept your results!! Whatever they are, they reflect you state of progress, and you can always move up, by changing and improving your attitude and procedures. Once you do, your daily, weekly or moonthly equity value fluctuations won't be a matter of life and death. And when that happens you will see things the way they are, with less internal biases. 






## Remove the symptom and solve the problem
It is beyond a doubt that most poblems, whether relational, econmical, etc... are not problems but symtoms of deeper problems. Problems such as :
1. Checking the prices constantly
2. Ignoring the market completely
3. Using excessive leverage
4. Executing orders contrary to your established plan
5. Executing impulive orders

These are merely symptoms of different problems. The small investor who rebels by using excessive leverage thinks, "Nobody notices my professional value so I'm gonna try to make it big so that people start to notice me." The small investor who ignores the market completely after a series of disappointment results, or the one that never looses touch with a single fluctuation because he is afraid he might miss an opportunity, is suffering from poor self-esteem. What these investors are really saying is: "notice me, trust me, guide me".

In many cases, if a trader feels that he failed to gain traction and sizable gains using his own trading style, he will start to use a different strategy based on somebody else's shiny performance. Which is unofrtunate because any trader/investor will really mess things up by trying to be someone else, but he would really have a chance at succeeding by being himself.

Also, once a trader finds his trading style, it isn't imperative that he gets immediate reward. He is not "out-of-business" if the market pushes a couple of losses into him. He can take many small losses for a while - as opposed to a single big one - until the big payday comes.

Almost without exception, those small trader/investors who use excessive leverage have a low self-esteem. They don't like and/or don't believe in their strategy. So they want to "make it big" quick, to put them out of the pain of trading that strategy. Tragically, the gains they get along the way go away quickly, making them dislike the whole experience even further.

You as a trader/investor, don't have to worry about these problems anymore. You have done and are doing things about your self-esteem, so now let's look at the choices you can make.

## Accept yourslef
- The market can't make you feel dumb or poor without your permission
- As you start to accept yourself, your insights and instincts, you will see them getting better, more meaningful and creating the gains you dream of.
- This results in your further improving your emotional balance, your self-esteem, and getting the good things in life.
- It's true: if you take care of your car it will take you places, and if you take care of your self-esteem it will take you places too.

# Chapter One 
(The way you see the market)

## The good finders
- A stuy was made of how 100 self-made millionaires. They were a diverse group but one trait that stood out was that: they were good "finders", they could see opportunities in every situation.
- The market is just an echo machine: whatever you send out comes back. Send out ignorance, debt and greed and you most likely will get losses. Send out research, savings and open mind, and you most likely get some profits.
- If you are looking for a strategy to give you the best return on capital invested, you should look for the opportunity in every market.
- It's common sense that you deal with the market the way you percive it. As a trader, you don't trade the instrument (bonds, stocks futures or options), you trader beliefs (over-valuation, under-valuation) that primarily come from your research.

## Don't take the moon down
- After you have made some money, mak sure to give it back. Many traders make some money and then try to keep it all for themselves. 
- At every trader throughout your career make sure to give thanks for the opportunity to do it. Whether it's a gain or a it's a loss, whether you are managing millions or paper trading. If the market is open and you are following it, be excited and be thankful.
- You will be lighter, more effective and more efficient. Your whole life will feel better. Why? It's impossible to express gratitude towards your job and not get a positive boost.
- Some say gratitude is just so much air - it's overrated - but like the air we use to fill the tires of our cars, they can really ease us along our career's highway.

## You are a business man
- Respect yourself and your trading account by viewing your trading activity as a business, and you as a businessman, not a gambler
- First chapter was about your potential as a trader. This chapter is about the market potential.
- Be inspired by God: you can reach the heights if you have the depths in your beliefs
- One person with a belief is worth 99 with only some interest
- If you build yourself mentally, morally, physically and spiritually your business will be built on the same foundations.
- You can get all the money in the world, if you just give enough of it away.
