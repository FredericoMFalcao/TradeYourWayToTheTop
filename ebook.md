TRADE YOUR WAY TO THE TOP

## Step Five
Build a helathy self-esteem with a series of short steps. One reason many people never attempt new things is their fear of failure. Start a new rading strategy with an amount you are confident you can handle, and then capitalize the gains. Paper trading can be usueful to build momentum in this context.

One sensible word of caution about self-esteem is appropriate ate this point. If you have been making an overdraft on the bank of confidence all your life, you cannot expect to bring your account up-to-date in one day or by reading this text only once. The longer and more regularly you take the necessary steps and follow the recommended procedures teh better chance ou have of achieveing your goals.


## Step Six
Join the smile and gratittude club. When you recognize and genuinely appreciate something hat is going well with your trading career, your motivation and chance to improve increase. If you are managing a portfolio of any size, you're a managing something!! It's a blessing! If you're following the financial world through TV, newspaper, podcast or radio, you are part of a larger system. Be appreciative!

## Step Seven
Give some money away. Especially if you feel poor, you must know that: (1) there is always someone that has it worst than ou do. By thinkning about them, by recognizing their value, by connecting with them, you begin to feel rich withtin yourself again. (2) you know that your goal is not strictly to accumulate money. It's probably to master a craft, to gather new insights, to feel like a contributing par tof a larger system. Wthout that the money woutld be meaningless.

## Step Eight.
Be careful with your associates. Deliberately choose input sources of values. The line between the financial industry and the gambling industry is a thin one. Many brokers and TV reporters benefit from excess activity and provide a sophisticated and expensive form of enterntainment. Prefer slow moving, "boring", sources that avoid the plagues of hyperactivity and hyperconnectnedenss. Prefer text to audio, and audio to video. Choose long structural content rather than short tactical one.

## Step Nine.
Make a list of your market edges, and keep themnearby. Check your memory for your past successses and try to determine what was your distinguishable quality. Why did you make it in the markets in the past when others didn't? What did you see? Why did you see that and others didn't?

## Step Ten.
Make a list of your top ten trades, to remind you of what is possible when you get some luck and your ind is in the right place.

## Step Eleven.
To build a ealthy self-esteem you need to avoid gambling. Trading for eterntainment is extremly expensive and psychologically damning. It shows human beings at their most vulnerable place, implying that the whole economic system is corrupted and that there aren't any legitimate ways to make money than taking a huge random risk.

## Step Tweleve. 
Fail forward. Keep a journal of your past failures, and to your best ability the interpretation of why they happened. Odds are strong that the leading traders in the world miss most times than all the other traders combined. These people succeed because they keep at it.  The big difference beween the big shot and the little shot is: the big shot is just a little shot who kept on shooting. There isn't a leader who wasn't a beginner.

## Step Thirteen
Accoutanbility is essential. Try to manage other people's money so that you are accountable.

## Step Fourteen
Put yourself out there. Your skilss have value, your trading might benefit somebody else's finanaces. Don't just trade for yourself benefiting your trading account. 

## Step Fifteen
Run a lean operation. Apart from your trading account, also focus on your bank account. How are you spending your euros? Is it in an useful way? Does it benefit yourself, your community and the world at large? If not, why?

Main message: Accept your results!! Whatever they are, they reflect you state of progress, and you can always move up, by changing and improving your attitude and procedures. Once you do, your daily, weekly or moonthly equity value fluctuations won't be a matter of life and death. And when that happens you will see things the way they are, with less internal biases.
